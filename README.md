# Yelp-Sentiment-Analysis
This tutorial will introduce you to some basic methods for processing Yelp data from Yelp Data Challenge,
particularly focusing on sentimental analysis on yelp data.
We will predict yelp star-rating of a review based on the text review of the customer.

For example, if the review is "Food was very delicious, Very good ambience." the rating is expected to be 5-star.
If the review is "very bad food, horrible taste." the rating is expected to be 1-star.
